The goal of this project was to recreate the website layout provided (target-site.png).

This felt achievable given the content taught in the previous lessons,  and I was able to complete it in about a day with the help of plenty of reference resources.

The project felt like the right level of difficulty, and was a good way to reinforce recent concepts learned.

Overall I prioritised getting close to the original image over making the design responsive at different screen widths. This probably wasn't the intention of the assignment, but I wanted to get close to what felt like a model answer to figure out how TOP achieved the layout.

I stalled on some parts when deciding on how to strcture the html/css, and when to use flexbox vs other options to get the desired layout. At this stage of my knowledge, it was difficult to know which methods were acceptable (many ways to solve a problem), or if one option was the superior approach to take (best practice).

One realisation was that flexbox is a powerful tool, but it feels like it relies on some elements having fixed height/width properties for reference. Alternatively you could make everything flex items and define ratios for their width, but that feels overkill when adding padding to a div would do. I'm not sure I've explained that clearly enough, but it will have to do for now.
